# JavaScript Coding Quiz
In this project I used Javascript to create a quiz about coding. I used a barebones HTML file and added the majority of my elements using Javascript. I used the CSS framework Bulma to style the majority of my page. The first attempt at this was awful but I studied up and rewatched some classes. With that and little Googling I was much more successful.

## Rules
1. When starting quiz the timer begins and a question appears
2. After answering the question a new answer comes up
3. Some indication if the players answer is correct or not
4. Time is subtracted for inncorrect answers
5. Player can save name and score after
